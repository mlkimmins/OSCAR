      " background : the present study was carried out to assess the effects of community nutrition intervention based on advocacy approach on malnutrition status among school - aged children in shiraz , iran.materials and methods : this case - control nutritional intervention has been done between 2008 and 2009 on 2897 primary and secondary school boys and girls ( 7 - 13 years old ) based on advocacy approach in shiraz , iran .   the project provided nutritious snacks in public schools over a 2-year period along with advocacy oriented actions in order to implement and promote nutritional intervention . for evaluation of effectiveness of the intervention growth monitoring indices of pre- and post - intervention were statistically compared.results:the frequency of subjects with body mass index lower than 5% decreased significantly after intervention among girls ( p = 0.02 ) .   however , there were no significant changes among boys or total population .   the mean of all anthropometric indices changed significantly after intervention both among girls and boys as well as in total population .   the pre- and post - test education assessment in both groups showed that the student 's average knowledge score has been significantly increased from 12.5  3.2 to 16.8  4.3 ( p < 0.0001).conclusion : this study demonstrates the potential success and scalability of school feeding programs in iran .   community nutrition intervention based on the advocacy process model is effective on reducing the prevalence of underweight specifically among female school aged children . \n",

      " background : the present study was carried out to assess the effects of community nutrition intervention based on advocacy approach on malnutrition status among school - aged children in shiraz , iran.materials and methods : this case - control nutritional intervention has been done between 2008 and 2009 on 2897 primary and secondary school boys and girls ( 7 - 13 years old ) based on advocacy approach in shiraz , iran .   the project provided nutritious snacks in public schools over a 2-year period along with advocacy oriented actions in order to implement and promote nutritional intervention . for evaluation of effectiveness of the intervention growth monitoring indices of pre- and post - intervention were statistically compared.results:the frequency of subjects with body mass index lower than 5% decreased significantly after intervention among girls ( p = 0.02 ) .   however , there were no significant changes among boys or total population .   the mean of all anthropometric indices changed significantly after intervention both among girls and boys as well as in total population .   the pre- and post - test education assessment in both groups showed that the student 's average knowledge score has been significantly increased from 12.5  3.2 to 16.8  4.3 ( p < 0.0001).conclusion : this study demonstrates the potential success and scalability of school feeding programs in iran .   community nutrition intervention based on the advocacy process model is effective on reducing the prevalence of underweight specifically among female school aged children . \n",
