       "      <td>both familial and twin studies suggest that genetic factors in power , speed and strength account for 35%~80% of inter - individual variation [ 6,28 - 30 ] . during the last two decades\\n, there has been considerable interest in finding the genetic factors responsible for human performance .\\nit has recently been reported that some candidate genes are related to human muscle power . among them , actn3 is one of the most interesting genes in that the actn3 variant ( actn3 r577x snp ) directly determines the expression of the -actinin-3 protein that contributes to the construction of the contractile component in power - generating fast twitch fibers of the skeletal muscle .\\nin addition , it has been reported that the functional individual difference of -actnin-3 protein expressed only in sarcomere of fast - twitch muscle fibers is not to be decided by multiple gene ( 170 counts ) diversity coding -actinin-3 but by actn3 r577x diversity such as dominant - recessive effect .\\nthis gene has a 1747c &gt; t transition within exon 16 , which results in the actn3 r577x snp , giving three genotypes : the rr , rx and xx genotypes . in the actn3 variant ( r577x snp ) , the xx genotype deficits -actinin-3 due to the premature stop codon without a pathological phenotype , whereas the rr and rx genotypes express -actinin-3 . as a result\\nan important structural component of the z disc is -actinin-3 , where it anchors actin thin filaments , helping to maintain the myofibrillar array only in fast twitch muscle fibers that are responsible for high velocity and force for power - generating contractions .\\nit has been suggested that the actn3 variant for the expression or deficiency of -actinin-3 in fast - twitch muscle fibers should influence the power - generating muscle function .\\nseveral studies have found that the actn3 variant affects the top - level elite athletes , and controls speed / power performance .\\nthe r allele and the rr genotype , expressing -actinin-3 , are overrepresented whereas the xx genotype for -actinin-3 deficiencies is underrepresented in sprint events , suggesting that -actinin-3 is required for sprint / power performance .\\nexperimental studies using actn3 ko mice have also shown that the absence of -actinin-3 results in fast - twitch , glycolytic fibers developing slower - twitch and poorer power generation , supporting the responsiveness of the -actinin-3 expression to optimal sprint and power performance .\\nthese results show that the actn3 variant is somewhat responsible for speed performance and also for determining some aspects of muscle power . however , previous research on the actn3 variant focused mainly on speed performance without differentiating its influence on the power components of speed and strength . because muscle power is the high - strength muscular performance that occurs over a short time period\\n, it is composed of speed and strength each of which can be differentiated independently and can also be determined by environmental and genetic factors .\\nthere is , however , a dearth of information on the association of strength , speed , or power with the actn3 variant . only association of power with the actn3 variant and association of speed with the actn3 variant are reported .\\nconsidering that the expression of sarcomeric -actinin-3 is located at the fast - twitch fiber that generates strong , high - velocity muscle contraction , there is a strong need to understand whether -actinin-3 is expressed or not and whether it should be associated with forceful contraction , i.e. muscle strength , for giving explosive power .\\ntherefore , the aim of this study is to examine the distribution of the actn3 r577x genotypes and alleles in poweroriented , speed - oriented and strength - oriented athletes and to search for differential associations of the power components with the actn3 r577x polymorphism .\\nall participants in this study were recruited from august , 1996 to december , 2011 .\\nall athletes in this study were members of the korean national team and university elite athletes and the control group consisted of non -

oriented athletes compared with the controls ( [df=1 ] = 0.396 , p &lt; 0.529 ) .\\nthe aim of this study is to explore an association of the actn3 genotype with speed and/or strength performance .\\nthe actn3 genotype distribution of korean top - level sprinters for speed , weightlifters for strength and mixed power - oriented athletes for power were compared to the actn3 genotype distribution of korean adults .\\nthere was a significant association of the actn3 genotype with power performance as was expected .\\nwhen dividing power performance into speed and strength performances , the actn3 genotype was only associated with speed performance but a relationship with strength performance was not identified .\\nthe actn3 xx genotype in deficit of the -actinin-3 protein in fast - twitch muscle fibers had a significantly low distribution in the speed performance group , while the distribution of the actn3 xx genotype showed a somewhat low ratio compared to the control group in the strength performance group with no statistical significance .\\ntherefore , speed performance among the power factors showed preference for the actn3 rr + rx genotype but not for the actn3 xx genotype .\\nthe association of the actn3 genotype with speed performance in this study is similar to previous study results .\\nyang et al .   reported reduced distribution of the actn3 xx genotype in sprint / power groups , composed of 7 australian judo elite athletes and 42 sprinters .\\nniemi and majamaa   and papadimitrou et al .   reported remarkably low levels of the actn3 xx genotype in greek sprinters .\\nin these studies , the distributions of the actn3 xx genotype in the control groups were about 18% similar to the 19% distribution fur the control group in our study . also , the authors reported low xx genotype distributions for sprinters ( 6% , 0% , and 8.8% ) compared to the control groups which agreed with our results of 6.9% .\\nthe actn3 genotype is favorable to sprint performance while the actn3 xx genotype lacking -actinin-3 is unfavorable to sprint performance .\\npapadimitrioum et al . , studied russian and greek populations respectively and reported that the distributions of the actn3 xx genotype were low in the power - oriented performance group compared to their control groups .\\nsantiago   also reported a reduced distribution of the xx genotype in spanish soccer players who needed explosive power through a combination of strength and speed .\\nin contrasr , neither nigerian nor greek track and field athletes skilled in power - oriented performance   showed any significant differences in their actn3 xx genotype distribution compared to the control groups .\\nthus , research on the association of actn3 with power - oriented performance has not shown consistent results .\\nit is well - known that the genetic structures of caucasians and africans are different , leading to some functionally different characteristics .\\nactually the xx genotype of the actn3 in caucasian is ~19% , higher than the 10% found in africans .\\nin addition , the differences in the composition of speed and strength athletes skilled in power - oriented performance may be another cause of the inconsistent association of actn3 with power performance .\\nthis study divided the actn3-associated power - oriented performance into speed performance and strength performance but the actn3 genotype distribution showed association only with speed performance and none with the strength performance .\\nthe coordination level of speed and strength affecting power - oriented performance may play an important role in determining the association between actn3 and power . as a result\\n, the association of the actn3 r577x variant with power - oriented performance would not show consistency and a variant that distinguishes the components of power into speed and strength would be needed to find the association of the actn3 variant with athletic performance . as there was no significant difference in the actn3 genotype distribution of korean top - level weightlifters with that of the control group in this study , the actn3 variant had no significant association with strength performance . because weightlifting requires a single maximal contraction of the skeletal muscle , it is essential for the skeletal muscle , especially for fast - twitch muscle fibers , to be hypertrophic .\\nit is expected that the distribution of the actn xx genotype was low because in the actn xx genotype , -actinin-3 is structured in the z - line of the fast - twitch muscle fiber that functions during rapid speed and strong power . however ,\\nin contrast with this hypothesis , the actn3 xx genotype was not significantly reduced in weightlifters .\\nsuch a result corresponded to previous study results with isokinetic strength performance of active young men and women .\\nthere was no difference in the isokinetic torque and rate of decline of torque between actn3 genotypes .\\nthese results including ours could support the contention that the lack of -actinin-3 in fast - twitch muscle fibers by the xx genotype only slightly affects the muscular strength of a single maximum contraction . on the other hand ,\\nthe null type of the -actinin-3 , actn3 xx genotype , showed a significantly low distribution in speed performance as consistently reported in previous studies and also in this study .\\ntherefore , it is thought that the -actinin-3 deficient genotype , the actn3 xx genotype , may affect speed performance that needs rapidly repeated muscular contractions . in the future\\n, it is necessary to explore the mechanism that causes the difference in the contraction of fast - twitch muscles that is due to the lack of -actinin-3 . in the case where the lack of -actinin-3 has no relation with the maximum muscular strength\\nthe actn3 xx genotype that is in deficit of -actinin-3 is confirmed to be strongly associated with speed performance that requires multiply repeated rapid muscle contractions .\\nthe actn3 xx genotype had no association with strength performance for single maximum muscle contractions among power components .\\ntherefore , we found suggestive evidence that the actn3 r577x polymorphism plays a role in discriminating speed performance athletes from strength athletes and sedentary controls .\\nin other words , the actn3 r577x variant is the main gene for speed performance but not for strength performance .</td>\n",
